## Issue #1: Google Login Not Working

**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

### What Happened?
When you clicked "Continue with Google" on the website, it said "authentication failed" and wouldn't let you log in.

### Why Did This Happen?
Think of it like trying to call your friend, but you don't have their phone number saved in your phone. The website (frontend) was trying to talk to the server (backend), but it didn't know where to find it or how to connect to Google.

There were 3 problems:

1. **The server wasn't running** - Like trying to call someone whose phone is turned off
2. **Wrong import name** - The code was looking for something called "profile_analytics" but it was actually called "analytics" (like looking for "John Smith" when the person's name is actually "John")  
3. **Missing phone numbers** - The website didn't have the special codes (environment variables) needed to talk to Google

### How We Fixed It:

1. **Started the server** - Turned on the backend server so it could answer requests
2. **Fixed the name** - Changed the code to look for "analytics" instead of "profile_analytics"
3. **Added the phone numbers** - Created a file called `.env.local` with the special codes:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` (where to find the server)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=153507...` (the special code to talk to Google)

### Test Results:
‚úÖ Backend server running on port 8000  
‚úÖ Frontend server running on port 3000  
‚úÖ Google OAuth URL generating correctly  
‚úÖ Environment variables configured  
‚úÖ Authentication flow working  

### What We Learned:
- Always check if servers are running first
- Make sure all the "phone numbers" (environment variables) are saved correctly
- Test each piece step by step instead of trying to fix everything at once
